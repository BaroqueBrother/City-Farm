# CityFarming
Harvesting wind energy from moving vehicles.
## About
The City Farmer project is one that aims to use renewable energy to power environmental sensors. In this application, I'm using the MQ-09 and MQ-131 sensors. The MQ-09 registers Carbon Dioxide levels while the MQ-131 measures ground-level Ozone levels. 

The device should be situated near or on roadways that supply a steady flow of mid to high speed traveling vehicles. Inside the device a 3.7v LiPo battery is what's used to store and transfer the energy captured from the draft wind. 

By being self-sustaining, and portable, the City Farmer gives us an opportunity to responsibly track environmental data.

My code will collect C02 and Ground Level Ozone data every hour and send it to an online dashboard where the information can represented by a graphical representation.
